# Machine-Learning
Work completed for assignments during the Machine Learning module of second year Computer Science. This module introduced Python and many Machine Learning strategies such as Polynomial Regression, K-Means Clustering, Data Processing, Plotting, and Artificial Neural Networks. Reports were also written discussing these strategies and their implementations.
